			#DCB-125-1-titl = 1.25m DaMichel's Cargo Bay (1m)
			#DCB-125-1-desc = This Cargo Bay is designed to fit in line to Rockomax parts. The innovative 4-piece folding doors require far less room for opening than a standard cargo bay, allowing you to store wider cargos, and deploy them in tighter spaces. This version of the cargo bay, the shortest, is 1 meter long for compactness.
